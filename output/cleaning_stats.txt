🧹 SQL Layoffs Data Cleaning Summary

📊 Original Data Source:
- Dataset initially loaded into a staging table to preserve raw data.

🔁 Duplicates Removed:
- Used ROW_NUMBER() with PARTITION BY on all columns to identify exact duplicate rows.
- Total duplicate rows removed: [insert actual number after counting, e.g., 120]

🔡 Text Standardization:
- Trimmed extra whitespace from company names.
- Normalized inconsistent industry names (e.g., "crypto tech", "CryptoCurrency" → "Crypto").
- Cleaned country names by removing trailing periods (e.g., "United States." → "United States").

📅 Format Corrections:
- Converted all dates to standard format `YYYY-MM-DD` for consistency.

🧮 Null Handling:
- Removed rows with nulls in critical columns (total_laid_off, company, location, etc.).
- Total null rows removed: [insert actual number]

📌 Final Dataset Shape:
- Total rows before cleaning: [insert original count]
- Total rows after cleaning: [insert cleaned count]
- Final columns: 9 (company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, date, stage, country, funds_raised_millions)

✅ Results:
- Dataset now clean, standardized, and ready for insightful analysis and visualization.
